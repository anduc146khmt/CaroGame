# Extended Projects

Maybe I think it a quite difficult for you to play with exe file in the black console, so I built a JavaScript version game and deploy for you to play in the website.

Here is the repo of JavaScript version (ReactJS): https://github.com/anduckhmt146/Tic-tac-toe

This game is also deployed at https://tic-tac-toe-9hsh.onrender.com/
